# Machines are good at crunching numbers - faster and more accurately than most humans!
# Create a small program that calculates something useful to you (making you smile is useful).
# It should take user input, at use at least one of the number operators we saw in class: + / * -.
# You may modify one of your previous exercises to include calculations, if you wish.
